SupportingReason Time Saved/Lost with SupportWhen looking for self help it is painful to find it. search hardly ever pulls what i am looking for. while many of us work in the tech industry we are not familiar with most technical jargon used by folks immersed in a specific technology. it may help to use layman terms to help us find self help resources in search.

SupportingReason Time Saved/Lost with SupportThere needs to be follow-up. i get follow-up from techlink and local resources. the global helpdesk is only interested in closing tickets to meet sla. if we get disconnected they do not reach out by email or skype. one time i fixed the issue by myself, left negative feedback. only then contacted me about the issue. this particular issue was extremely urgent and i made that known upfront. i tend to avoid using global helpdesk if at all possible since my experiences continue to be subpar.

SupportingReason Time Saved/Lost with Support1. VPN issues - contacting hydhelp always redirects me to contact global Helpdesk. contacting global Helpdesk requires me to be available on chat while the issue is being diagnosed. there have been so many VPN issues which I have faced while working from home. always spending an hour to fix it only to have it happen again is extremely frustrating. MSIT AutoVPN was the one service which always worked and that got discontinued. now the existing services MSITVPN and MSFTVPN are extremely flaky, and I have never been able to troubleshoot them properly. they keep happening again and again. now, if one service starts working, tomorrow, it will get discontinued without any intimation or justification. Abrupt disconnects happen while working from home all the time. Reconnect requires signing in again with phone authentication, even if I have recently signed in this problem should go away with MSFTVPN, but that has not worked for me. there has to be a permanent solution, and support on this has been very dissatisfactory. 2. the online portal http CSEWeb is not easily discoverable. I came to know of it while filling this survey, there were a lot of times when I just thought I wanted to file an online ticket, but did not have the resources. Redirecting from http ITWeb is so slow, that I usually end up closing the browser tab out of frustration. 3. if I do not work on my laptop from home for a while, the domain controller suddenly forgets that the machine is domain joined and it results in a weird limbo state where I am unable to login into the machine, especially if the password has changed.

SupportingReason Time Saved/Lost with SupportTechlink experience has been 100 good. However online support helped very little if at all...

SupportingSupport general verbatimThe lenovo p51 is a great laptop to use however, the reason i gave this primary work device a negative mark is because it is extremely heavy and has been causing lower back pain. the power supply is also extremely heavy. although i am an inside sales tsp, i take my laptop home with me for working from home and i also travel on occasion. i had to travel to seattle recently for a conference and carrying the p51 around was less than ideal. it has also been difficult carrying it around the building to various meetings. i i am from a wave that was not supplied with a surface. although the p51 is powerful enough to carry out all of our work easily, it is not the most practical laptop in terms of mobility. i would love to see the reinstatement of the surface for tsps who do not have one for going to meetings traveling or replacing the p51 with a more light weight laptop.
SupportingReason Time Saved/Lost with SupportIn one case, my saw_ machine had a malfunctioning tpm that was locking me out after a reinstall immediately after setting my bitlocker pin for the first time. this means i had to reimage my machine every few days. when i actually walked into the techlink and had humans help me, the person helping me quickly agreed with my conclusion about the tpm module and had it fixed in a day. having a working machine is great for productivity. in the other, my surface book hinge was starting to malfunction and would constantly connect disconnect the screen without it moving, meaning i could not use my preferred laptop in meetings. they showed me it was possible to plug just the screen into the dock, so i could get a backup, and ordered a replacement for me.

SupportingSupport general verbatimI think that many of the folks I reach in support want to do a good job, but wanting is not delivering. a prime example of this is the meeting rooms in building 30. every single one I have been in with the Logitech entertainment consoles the rebranded, rubber-wrapped Surface RTs constantly disconnects and reconnects the camera. the whole meeting, the camera in any given room pans back and forth and video intermittently comes on and off while the Windows device connected and device disconnected chimes play over and over - it is quite disruptive. when I spoke with the AV guys about it on meetinghelp, I was informed that it is a known issue and there is currently no fix. Well, great - in the meantime I am have to meet in a building less than two years old with only half-functional AV equipment.

SupportingSupport general verbatimThe most often i ask help for cse are network down type of issues. i usually call from skype to ask help. usually what happens is that the engineer who receives my call takes time to understand what the issue is. then he she escalate it to the next level support, however the first person does never write comprehensive description of the issue, so i have to explain what the problem is from the beginning over and over again. also, because of the timezone differences between the cse core network engineer and myself, it take days to resolve the issue. this is very painful.

SupportingReason Time Saved/Lost with SupportResponse times and time to resolved issue. on stickers in conference rooms there are stickers saying for immediate assistance, setting the expectation that a tech person would come to the room to replace broken hdmi connectors etc but it usually takes more time than you typically have in the meeting. putting sensors detecting faulty equipment to be able to replace broken equipment proactively would be good. this feedback applies to fixing broken equipment ie not user not knowing how to handle the systems
SupportingSupport general verbatimThere are too many ways to use av equipment, between surface hubs, polycoms and other rooms with different technologies. i realize it is work in process as we upgrade and cannot upgrade all rooms for economical and logistical reasons but it does create complexity when entering a new room and having to figure out how does this one work now?

SupportingSupport general verbatimThe live support i get from cse is usually very good and prompt as contrasted with helpbot support that automatically raises the current issues without regard for relevance to the problem i raised. it would be more useful to have links to resources where i can check the status of bugs or service degradation in my area and an expected resolution. what i do not like is being kept in the dark or the perception that nobody is aware of the problem even though many people are being affected. think missioncontrol for productivity-impairment.

SupportingAV Link by CSE - Conference room audio-visual support - Other (please specify)We do not have time to get support from cse when the conference room av support is not working. so we have to just keep dealing with broken equipment or avoid that conference room.
SupportingSupport general verbatimThe staff are a great support, when contacted. they are professional, courteous, and committed to resolution. it is the fact that it take so much time to troubleshoot skype, or the meeting room connectivity that i feel as if i need to build in at least 10 minutes prior to each meeting in order to guarantee that we will be able to use the technology for the meeting. i would love for the day when i can walk into a meeting, and everything just works!

I had to work with my admin to solve it, and the equipment I got from my admin is not actually working very well, but it was the last Surface dock they had for my machine, and that is all there was to fix the problem. so I am working around problems even now, in an attempt to display my screen. CSE understood the problem but the solve is still an issue and I struggle with it regularly. it still affects my productivity to this day, trying to plug in USB ports directly to my laptop rather than the hub, but then they are still in my computer when I need to plug into something else. please bring more Surface docks back that are functioning correctly so we can actually use and display our computers on more screens so we can get work done.
SupportingReason Time Saved/Lost with SupportThere are two aspects technical and process technical major changes like, moving from skypefb to teams, without any communications and many defects impacting me for example, should be avoided. process i am not sure which framework we use internal, but to mention an example, case closure, is most of time, one sided! cse decide it is solved and close the case, without any verification. some emails, have not enough resources, for example a link to portal.
SupportingReason Time Saved/Lost with SupportTechlink is the most efficient

SupportingReason Time Saved/Lost with SupportOur search tool is too poor to understand what i am searching for.
SupportingSupport general verbatimIt is not clear to me what support cse provides vs when i should go elsewhere. i know cse is relatively new branding but would be good to reinforce what it covers, what you can count on cse to provide.
SupportingReason Time Saved/Lost with SupportOnce ticket is opened, generally first contacted by off shore resource who, it seems, is following a script. i work for microsoft in a technical position i am capable of troubleshooting and only open support tickets for things i cannot resolve for example, hardware issues. running through a script to repeat basic troubleshooting steps wastes their time and mine.
SupportingSupport general verbatimI just cannot find information online. there are thousand places where can I search and some time I find information on one place sometime on another. it would be much better experience if there was one page where I can search everything. so if I cannot find information I just ask people. and guys from local CSE are very helpful. they are great.

SupportingReason Time Saved/Lost with SupportMake it easier to find answers online and create an interactive tool to step you through with questions that lead you to the correct steps. i am sure some place all the information is in the cse web pages or self help, but it is so hard to find what i needed to do to get remote access, join a domain, get the certificates installed, and install the apps i needed to do my job from a new machine. it did not use to be this challenging. i end up going to techlink because the answers and steps are not clearly outlined. i spent two and half days trying to get what i needed on a new machine and will end up going to techlink to try to resolve existing issues that i am having. make it easier to find answers and get help with tools and devices. techlink is a life saver and one of the best things we have to get help but you have to schedule it into your day and find the closest one and then maybe still wait in a queue

SupportingReason Time Saved/Lost with SupportMy biggest issue is getting conference rooms to behave the way they are supposed to. because it is not currently practical to get cse support when a meeting is trying to get kicked off, we tend to muddle our way through meetings using work arounds. anything that can be done to improve this would be appreciated.
SupportingSelf Service (Pointers for Elite) - Other (please specify)Do not know what this is
SupportingSupport general verbatimnone
SupportingSupport general verbatimThere is a complete lack of urgency in the support staff. they are not microsoft people working for the common good of the company, they are disenfranchised hourly contractors just doing the bare minimum to get by. device support at microsoft should be an imperative service to the company, especially in the field where we are customer facing. it is an awkward conversation that i am using my own personal device to support the company because cse cannot make it work.
SupportingSupport general verbatimThis is about the hyderabad team that provides laptops etc. they are just useless, there is nothing more useless than them in microsoft.
SupportingSupport general verbatimI typically self-service any problems that I have and have generally been pleased with the overall performance of resources. I usually check first for known issues, though I often find that the problems listed do not seem current.

SupportingTech Link (including Deskside Support Services) - Other (please specify)The answer to any laptop problem seems to be to re-image it. it is lazy and a productivity killer.
SupportingSupport general verbatimI already answered this question.
SupportingSupport general verbatimMost issues are faster for me to fix than going through cse. getting support is easy -waiting for resolution is not.
SupportingSupport general verbatimEspecially for av in a room, it should just work.
SupportingSupport general verbatimWhen i have had to use support, the people individuals helping me have been great. however, the process to get help is onerous, and the frequency with which i have issues with my computer and services is so great that i do not feel like i have time to actually get support. i would be spending 2-4 hours each day getting support. things do not work well to keep me productive. for instance, over the last month or two it is hard to keep track, i have to restart my computer when i undock it to go to a meeting because outlook is no longer connected, and does not want to connect even when i log in, either using my password, my pin, or authenticate with my phone. it accepts the credentials, or is authenticated, then i get the same pop up to log in again. because i do not have the 2-4 hours to go sit in techlink, i just restart each time.
SupportingReason Time Saved/Lost with SupportPhone authentication approval issues took more than a week to resolve in spite of multiple escalations. i had 3 new vendors operating with no email for close to a week and a half.
SupportingReason Time Saved/Lost with SupportI use support as little as possible because I rarely get positive results. self help would be better if search was improved. and overall support would be better if the goal was to resolve the issue as opposed to closing the ticket.
SupportingReason Time Saved/Lost with SupportOnsite resources are really helpful in comparison to global helpdesk!
SupportingReason Time Saved/Lost with SupportI do not have many issues as I use my own device typically

SupportingSupport general verbatimNIL
SupportingReason Time Saved/Lost with SupportTicket systems between each tier do not seem to be aligned. i had a ticket open for 2 months with t2 t3 but t1 had closed the ticket. the ticket should not be closed regardless of what tier you are working with. the total time the ticket or issue has been open is from when i first call the helpdesk not when the transition it to another tier. i do not believe the helpdesk can be accountable unless they are until the original ticket is closed when the issue is actually resolved. me having to drive the issue for 2 months with non response tier levels is not acceptable and finally i only got assistance and resolution because i started emailing full time employee resources up the chain of command. total time to close my ticket was over 2 months. that is absolutely unacceptable and i believe i did not show up on any report showing this unacceptable timeline.
SupportingSupport general verbatimMay be it would be a good idea to streamline gethelp and cse budgets, processes and tools to better support microsoft is core business functions. just my 0.02
SupportingReason Time Saved/Lost with SupportA way for more technical users to get past tier1. do not like having to go to techlink for support, it is not a productive use of time. would suggest a pickup drop-off service for techlink.
SupportingReason Time Saved/Lost with SupportTry to make the image that actually works on the device, rather than eating up all the resources and hanging the OS and tools which can be only solved by restarting device everyday or sometimes twice a day. horrible and completely arrogant attitude towards the employees to get such images released. if it was my customer, they would have already gone up to Satya escalating, but since it is Microsoft staff who is affected - no one actually cares. as to what fixes needs to be done, I leave it up to you to find where the process is broken - may be more diverse testing is required both for variety of devices and variety of users before image is released. may be you need to hire a testing professional to advise how to improve.
SupportingReason Time Saved/Lost with SupportSet expectation upfront otherwise i am expecting things to be fixed now. ex. telling me that my concern is being addressed and someone will get to me shortly does not tell me when this will be addressed.
SupportingReason Time Saved/Lost with SupportGetting support from cse to fix issues helps me to save time in fixing my issue, thus leading to improvement in productivity

SupportingReason Time Saved/Lost with SupportCSE needs to offer better support for resolving issues. it is the perception that everything will be fixed by re-image which may be true but takes substantial time in remote conditions
SupportingSupport general verbatimNo comments b c i did not use cse to fix anything. my usual course of action is to reinstall myself. it is faster than trying to get help from cse.
SupportingSupport general verbatimI am sorry to say my colleagues and I have given up on both the email and local support and tend to try and solve problems among ourselves or via our manager.
SupportingReason Time Saved/Lost with SupportGetting more deskside support
SupportingReason Time Saved/Lost with SupportCSE helped with a recurring VPN connectivity issue I experienced. when I call the Helpdesk, I do not wait long for a knowledgeable engineer to greet me.
SupportingReason Time Saved/Lost with SupportThe technicians need better training to deal with certain issues like windows bugs, for example or they need an escalation path to refer the customer to a higher tier level of support.
SupportingReason Time Saved/Lost with SupportIt is a tricky question because if i am getting support, it is because something is not working which obviously impacts productivity negatively. it takes time to 1 find time to work through the issue and then 2 work through the issue. but once i can get to the right person at helpdesk, they are typically fabulous though sometimes accents are a bit of a communication barrier
SupportingReason Time Saved/Lost with SupportTo not have the problem at all so i do not have to open a ticket. i feel trapped each time i open a case because i need assistance at the moment. my schedule is so packed that after opening a case where someone needs to jump on my machine to do something dies on the vine. i do not have time for that and would prefer they send the steps to perform at my convenience. i cannot risk someone making my machine worse when i am serving customers.
SupportingReason Time Saved/Lost with SupportGo back to using full time employee is that actually know what they are doing. i have been doing pc repair for 25 years, if i say something is broken i have already spent forever on the problem before i take it to the tech. using the cheapest labor we can find off the street provides zero actual support. i am a rehire and my new device was dead on arrival, it kept randomly rebooting. i spent the better part of 2 months trying to get the tech to actually fix it. i finally gave up and bought my own machine. my corporate device is sitting turned off on a shelf in my house. i had three other incidents where i opened a helpdesk ticket and then was ping-ponged between three groups for help that never actually resolved my issue.
SupportingReason Time Saved/Lost with SupportThe need to drop everything so they can take over my computer with remote assistance which requires installing some very scary and dangerous software on my computer is a deal breaker. they just futz around with my computer in pretty clueless ways, and usually mess things up worse than when they started. it is extremely unlikely when i call helpdesk it is something that can be fixed on my computer, and it usually takes me a few hours to undo the damage they cause to my computer after the assistance is over and to get the context back that i had to close so they could click buttons. and the issue is never resolved because, in general, whatever script the engineer is reading i have already tried... why not just let me see the script myself? usually i just live with whatever the problem is because the endless struggle with support is not worth it.
SupportingSupport general verbatimWhen a microsoft user contacts the helpdesk using any mechanism - the user should know their ticket is open until resolved. transferring tickets from one tier to another should be invisible to the user but the ticket should be visible to all. when the processes if failing there is no communicated way for a user to get a person with authority to get involved. i spent almost 2 weeks getting someone to help me drive traction. i should not have to resort to going through the gal and looking for management and executives to get traction. this is so not acceptable and not a way to treat users contacting you for help.
SupportingSupport general verbatimN a. do not request support very often
SupportingReason Time Saved/Lost with SupportI do not know where CSE support starts and application support ends. for example, apps have a feedback feature. I cannot get Infopedia 3.0 to install without a fatal error registering the service. without that, alerts from Infopedia are not communicated to my Windows_Windows notification center. so this is 1 a huge efficiency loss and 2 whoever is working this issue has had it for weeks and I only hear back when I ping them. so again, I do not know if that IP support or CSE. more specifically on desktop image services, I have used the desks at both Redmond, NYC and Malvern. Nobody can explain why I keep getting messages from the software center that updates are ready to install there are none. when asked why I must manually connect to VPN because it stopped connecting automatically, the support person just shook his head and said that is because MSIT is doing stuff and it broke stuff. I know that is not fair to the techs who are good but they could not solve this issue and I am still annoyed by constant reminders from the software center that I have updates to apply when there are none.

SupportingAV Link by CSE - Conference room audio-visual support - Other (please specify)??????????????????????????????
SupportingReason Time Saved/Lost with SupportMy impression of a lot of interactions has been to get a ticket closed as soon as possible, rather than actually fix my issue. that would be a start.

SupportingSupport general verbatimStill not sure what cse is responsible for based on the questions. i will say it normally takes me over 30 minutes to figure out where to open a new support request when i need to do it. maybe its because i do it so infrequently, but if someone was to ask me i normally start at aka_ms msw and start searching from there. i know there is some app installed on my machine that i can do it through, but can never remember the name or where to look for it. the process of opening a request actually becomes more frustrating than whatever the problem i am trying to fix. easier to build a workaround myself.
SupportingReason Time Saved/Lost with SupportWorking around my schedule for availability instead of just firing off an im and hoping for the best, and not being so eager to close tickets without resolving the issue. my saw_ issue is intermittent which means i have virtually no chance of getting the help i need from cse as the tickets are regularly closed when the issue does not repro on demand.

SupportingSupport general verbatimFor a tech company, we do not seem to understand our own products. too many of the i_t issues i run into are rooted in windows_windows or office, yet no one in cse seems able or willing to dig into them deeply enough to resolve them. most of the time, when an issue stops me from doing my work, i either remove and reinstall the app with which i am struggling, or i reimage my machine. those are the two solutions that cse seems to have available. once in a while, i have gotten a person who seems to know more and they will walk through different solutions like clearing corrupted data. but those are rare individuals. maybe the best solution is to reduce the pc refresh cycle to about 2 years, which seems to be the time os updates, office updates, and storage limitations on the individual machine seems to conspire to render that pc a high-priced door stop.

SupportingSupport general verbatimI find that most issues I can resolve myself and there is no need to open a ticket online or visit the Techlink kiosks. when I do have a problem that I was unable to resolve, the fix has always been after a major software push after patch Tuesday, and sometimes the only fix has been to have the Techlink guys reimage the system. one time recently HP had a software tool designed to see if your laptop battery was one that was recalled. Mine was. I had HP send me the replacement and the guys at Techlink were good to enough to swap it out for me because I did not have the small torx wrench to take the laptop apart. I sent the faulty battery back to HP. Tops marks to the guys at the Redwest Techlink desk.

SupportingReason Time Saved/Lost with SupportThe main thing is just getting higher skilled more knowledgeable better trained people handling support calls. generally speaking, if i cannot quickly figure out the issue myself, a tier 1 support tech will not either but i usually have to waste at least an hour with tier 1 before getting someone who has a chance of understanding what is going on, and then i have to wait for that person to call me, which is not an ideal work flow. i know it is expensive, but microsoft is a company of engineers, so the expectation of our support calls should be leveled accordingly.

SupportingReason Time Saved/Lost with SupportPlease, please, please stop being reactive to conference room av issues and frequently check the rooms to ensure the equipment is working. time and time again meetings are delayed or significant time is lost to screens that will not project, phones that will not communicate, cables that do not connect. at the most conservative estimate of what our loaded full time employee cost is, the expense is huge. four people in a meeting that starts 10 minutes late at 150 hour full time employee is 100 in employee cost, excluding the opportunity cost of the meeting that did not happen as well as it should. certainly we can check a conference room for function once a month for 100, right?

SupportingSupport general verbatimThis survey is way too long. please shorten all the question.
SupportingReason Time Saved/Lost with SupportHad a number of issues working with nick spencer from techlink. he is always on the phone, does not respond to emails for tickets on time, shoots darts at troubleshooting issues, miss-diagnosed issues that other tech support agents resolved successfully. you need system that collects feedback and holds accountability. current does not see to work. every time i open a ticket, nick spencer is assigned in the last two years for me and my team members. our team admin and i provided feedback about his in-effectiveness, no action is taken. same behaviors persist.
SupportingReason Time Saved/Lost with SupportCustomer end user centricity and willingness to troubleshoot the problems first before reverting to the usual course of flatten and rebuild. my manager for example was experiencing an issue on office365 proplus in terms of performance and reliability. she followed due process and visited the techlink area at the johannesburg office. 6 hours later and her machine was ready. 6 hours loss of productivity - 6 hours delay in manager approving discount requests for deals. local techlink personal refused to troubleshoot the issue and flattened and rebuilt the machine due to an issue of word not being able to open .document attachments in outlook.
SupportingReason Time Saved/Lost with SupportI was able to quickly get resolution so that I could continue working on my project and data review. without their timely assistance, I was stuck, not making progress at all.

SupportingReason Time Saved/Lost with SupportIt did not, other than it solved a core problem that prevented me from getting a task done such as with manager self service tool
SupportingReason Time Saved/Lost with SupportMost of my support requests have had to do with my saw_ machine. in all cases, they have been very responsive and was able to fix the issue remotely. i would not say it improved my productivity though, since the issues themselves was created from updates and not from anything i did, which in the end ate away at my productivity. but, it was great to see the quick turn around.
SupportingReason Time Saved/Lost with SupportI work at a remote site Raleigh NC and do not have access to Techlink and other services available in Redmond. having to ship hardware to Charlotte to get it worked on is frustrating and takes time. there is little onsite support for issues, everything needs to be done via IM email Skype etc.

SupportingReason Time Saved/Lost with SupportAs much as i hate calling the helpdesk... they are almost always super helpful and quick to resolve.
SupportingReason Time Saved/Lost with SupportI find that it takes some period of time for Helpdesk to respond to me after I open a ticket. However, if I do not respond back almost immediately literally they jump on sending a we have not heard back from you and we are going to close the ticket ... mail
SupportingSupport general verbatimMy overall support experience has never been outstanding. i think the local techlink sites are excellent and we need more of that personal experience. when you have an organization where you have highly technical people it is frustrating going to people that cannot help you or start from the beginning when you call on the phone. i avoid calling the helpdesk unless it is absolutely necessary.

SupportingReason Time Saved/Lost with SupportMake it quicker, if the computer is the problem, just get a new one. having to swap to a loaner for a week or 2 only to then swap back to your device, that is better, but not at 100 is not ideal and causes a lot of lost time as you have to make sure everything you need is moved to the loaner, then re-install and re set up your old device once you get it back.

SupportingSupport general verbatimTwo things... 1. the self-service support experience could be vastly improved by aggressively keeping the documentation up to date around each of the major workflows such as ras access. ideally, there should be a database of the workflows, documents, tools, owners, etc., and a process whereby any change made to a core prompts an immediate update to the associated documents. 2. this survey would get better data if it started with a more detailed summary or what services cse provides. acronyms change here and i was halfway through before i figured out that cse itg at least that is what it was in the late 90 is when i started here and a lot of us are creatures of habit.

SupportingReason Time Saved/Lost with SupportThe cseweb alert center is the first place i check when i have network connectivity and when i have a technical problem. i want to see if i am part of a larger issue. the main problem lately has been sporadic failures to connect to network resources, possibly after a windows or office update, but there is no indication that this is a known issue on cseweb alert center. i find myself turning to yammer more and more to see what others are reporting as issues to see if they have a solution. it turns out that i was able to find crowd sourced solution to a problem starting powerbi. it seems there was an update to the malware detection toolkit that prevented powerbi from connecting, but again no mention of this on the cseweb alert center. first, if a statistically significant portion of the workforce is sidelined by a bad update or some other issue that i would expect cse to have telemetry on, let is first stop shooting ourselves in the foot and also communicate remediation steps widely. instead for weeks what i see on cseweb alert center was irrelevant to my geographical area and discussed manufacturing line issues. maybe the alerts should be scoped by geographical relevance? our productivity depends on timely resolution of blocking issues and i expect cse to play a key role here.

SupportingReason Time Saved/Lost with SupportWhat is cse? does it support i_t or an engineering team that works on i_t products?
SupportingSupport general verbatimI provide detailed description of steps I performed to resolve, then the help contacts me on Skype and have me repeat the same steps! sometimes the case is elevated and the elevated support does the same! in last incident, this repeated until the ticket was elevated to tier 3 who expertly resolved the issue. Rather than reaching me on Skype to walk me through, I would prefer to have written stops with request for specific information to collect and send back so that I do not have to set up time to Skype CSE. without having the engineer intervene to run the diagnostic steps, it should be possible to instrument scripts tools that run diagnostics in the background, collect whatever needed diagnostic results and implement the fix as needed.

SupportingReason Time Saved/Lost with SupportStuff that did not work, worked!
SupportingReason Time Saved/Lost with SupportSupport personal should read notes in the ticket rather than asking the same questions again. also honoring the information about working hours added when opening the ticket would be great. why ask again for the working hours if i provided them in the verbatim when opening the ticket? why getting contacted in the middle of the night or during weekends although i specified my working hours?
SupportingSupport general verbatimI have found recent name changes, process changes, and site changes, more confusing then helpful. with all of the changes, it is difficult to keep track of how to do things or even what name to now search for. at least having some links to definitions and means of things would help greatly in knowing if I am even looking at something relevant to what I want.

SupportingReason Time Saved/Lost with SupportNo comments
SupportingReason Time Saved/Lost with SupportI am very unhappy overall about the process of approving third party software. the website with regulations about third party software is unclear. for example, if I submit an application, is it just for me or for my team? Further, is open source software treated the same? some I_T contacts told me yes, others told me no. it seems like everyone has a different understanding of how the process is supposed to work. it is also very tedious to have everyone in our office submit an approval form for every single piece of software we install that is not released by Microsoft. this takes so much development time if every single worker needs to submit an application for every single productivity app they use. this process has been difficult at all levels. I cannot find the information I want, no one seems to have the direct answers, when I did have someone answer my questions they did a poor job and did not seem to take the time to understand my question. Then, after all of that, the process for approving third party software takes forever, and the forms are confusing and hard to complete.
SupportingSupport general verbatimCSE has seriously mis-managed the IP space and network within Microsoft and as a result productivity has come to a stand still. we are forced into the cloud but cannot move there because we do not have IP addresses for DevTest Labs VMs and lack ExpressRoute capacity for moving our infrastructure to Azure.

SupportingSupport general verbatimGetting support is hardly required. the cse team in the netherlands are rock stars. with my surface pro 4, azure active directory joined, intune managed i have almost never issues. vpn msftvpn works great too. so hardly any need for support but if i need it, it is great. cse nl is not responsible for the trouble with the phone policy windows phone issues. not blaming them.
SupportingReason Time Saved/Lost with SupportSimpler way to get support for remote sites that do not have dedicated technicians.
SupportingSupport general verbatimI have asked for a replacement device multiple times to provide stability. I keep getting the same model of device. I am trying a different options now asking for a loaner. we will see if that helps. my Surface book device is not stable. I have constant display issues and occasional bluescreens. I am on my third Surface book device. while I like the design and idea, due to stability I would not recommend this device to anyone. I continue to have the same issue documented in 3 separate cases. luckily my personal Macbook works much better running Windows_Windows than my MSIT provided Surface book. I use that full time when working from home but it is not appropriate for taking onsite to my customers.
SupportingReason Time Saved/Lost with SupportThis feedback is for the techlink teams that work in hyderabad office. they are just not helpful at all, even indian government offices are more efficient than them. they do not speak english at all and have never been able to help with anything, even getting a new mouse is so tedious that you will end up buying a mouse from amazon than breaking your head with them. they have not been able to fix my laptop for last 8 months and i have faced huge issues because of this but there is nobody to help at all.
SupportingReason Time Saved/Lost with SupportTechlink is too far from my office. its several buildings away, and has a long line. I have to use my personal cell phone to get support, because Skype and networking is the problem many times.

SupportingReason Time Saved/Lost with SupportThe support is working brilliant, and getting things fixed, automatically improves my productivity.
SupportingSupport general verbatimIt is very important to get local support. so, please, keep it.
SupportingSupport general verbatimThe last helpdesk interaction i had was very good. the technician was able to address a relatively sticky issue in a timely manner and get me back connected with corpnet.
SupportingSupport general verbatimTier 3 is very good, but tier 1 aims to close tickets instead of helping. if they are not sure, forward to tier 3, instead of closing tickets. for example, in saw_, their classic response is to reimage saw_ when problems occur. reimaging is very disruptive, and should not be provided as a default solution.
SupportingSupport general verbatimIt is okay
SupportingSupport general verbatimNothing to add
SupportingReason Time Saved/Lost with SupportGetting a new machine that does not crash due to memory issues, has increased my productivity.
SupportingReason Time Saved/Lost with SupportProvide more relevant self-help support. train techlink staff to do more than remove and reinstall apps or reimage machines. make it easier to find information about issues. do not blow off issues that do not arise often they may be precursors to larger issues. allow helpdesk personnel to gauge an individual is level of technical expertise in order to engage them at the point where the individual is stuck rather than requiring that they again perform basic steps like rebooting. keep self-help and other online content up to date too many broken links in the current website.
